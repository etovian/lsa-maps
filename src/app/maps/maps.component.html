            LCMS congregations have been building and maintaining Lutheran schools since the founding of the LCMS in 1847.  Because of our strong commitment to Lutheran education, it was common for schools to be built soon after the church and be maintained by the local individual congregations to serve the needs of the children in preparing them for adulthood.
